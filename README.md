Monorepo for a microservices-based platform where users can create, manage, organize (into collections), tag, and search for "knowledge snippets" (code, commands, notes, links). The platform will feature robust authentication, an API gateway, event-driven updates for search indexing via Kafka, and comprehensive telemetry.
